# Covid_api_script

This is a personal project to understand how to get data from api and make some form of data analysis on the data!

This script gets data from Isle of Wight covid data to find out the trend of covid in that area during the covid period!

 ⚠️ Warning:  The data isnt avaliable anymore as of 12/01/2021
 
 However to run this code you clone the respository into a selected area using:
 
 `` git clone https://github.com/SaabriinMo/Covid_api_script.git``
 
 Then run the script using :
 
 FOR MACOS:
 ``python3 ap3.py``
 
 FOR WINDOWS:

``python ap3.py`` or ``python3 ap3.py``

Thanks for visiting!
